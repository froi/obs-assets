# OBS Scene Collection and Sketch project

## OBS Scene Collection

This contains the OBS configuration I use to make live streams. There is plenty there that you might not need. All paths to assets need to be changed to your own paths.

### How to use the OBS Scene

1. Open OBS
1. Click on the __Scene Collection__ menu.
1. Select __Import__
1. Once imported you might have to select the scene. You can do so by clickig on the __Scene Collection__ menu.
   * At the end of the menu you will see the lists you can choose from. Select your imported scene.
   * You might also find that some elements are missing. I've noticed that audio settings don't import 100%. You will have to add your audio and video settings as you like them.
1. Make any changes you need.

## obs-setup

This file contains all assets used in the OBS Scene Colleciton. You need Sketch to export them. I recomend you making your own assets to fit you personal style and taste.
